# xendit-test

Legit is just a coding test. Nothing to see here (unless if you're a part of Xendit).

# How to run

```
npm run bootstrap
npm run start
```

# Configuring eBay API keys

1. Go to `./packages/api`
2. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the required values in the file (e.g. `mv .env.sample .env`).

# Deploying the project

Manually deployed for now.
